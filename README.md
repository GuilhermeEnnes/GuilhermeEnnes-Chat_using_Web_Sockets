# GuilhermeEnnes-Chat_using_Web_Sockets

 This was a project made during the NLW 5 ( Next Level Week) with Node.JS using TypeScript, TypeORM and WEB SOCKETS
 in order to build a chat 
 
 There are some improvements that gonna be done in the future, but the goals it self was to see those tools in action and the benefits of them.
